However, the uncertainty of associating target with source sentences makes UNMT theoretically an ill-posed problem. This work investigates the possibility of utilizing images for disambiguation to improve the performance of UNMT. Our assumption is intuitively based on the invariant property of image, i.e., the description of the same visual content by different languages should be approximately similar. We propose an unsupervised multi-modal machine translation (UMNMT) framework based on the language translation cycle consistency loss conditional on the image, targeting to learn the bidirectional multi-modal translation simultaneously. Through an alternate training between multi-modal and uni-modal, our inference model can translate with or without the image. On the widely used Multi30K dataset, the experimental results of our approach are significantly better than those of the text-only UNMT on the 2016 test dataset.","tags":null,"title":"Unsupervised Multi-Modal Neural Machine Translation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nguyen Bach","Hongjie Chen","Kai Fan","Cheung-Chi Leung","Bo Li","Chongjia Ni","Rong Tong","Pei Zhang","Boxing Chen","Bin Ma","Fei Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"288af1f12439b748676cb3010cd1ed4b","permalink":"https://nguyenbh.github.io/publication/alibaba-2018-iwslt/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T04:59:39.215995Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alibaba-2018-iwslt/","section":"publication","summary":"This work describes the Enâ†’De Alibaba speech translation system developed for the evaluation campaign of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) 2018.

The corpus was labeled on the syllabic level and analyzed using the Fujisaki model. Results show that the six tone types basically fall into two categories: Level, rising, curve and falling tone can be accurately modeled by using tone commands of positive or negative polarity. The so-called drop and broken tones, however, obviously require a special control causing creaky voice and in cases a very fast drop in F0 leading to temporary F0 halving or even quartering. In contrast to the drop tone, the broken tone exhibits an F0 rise and hence a positive tone command right after the creak occurs. Further observations suggest that drop and broken tone do not only differ from the other four tones with respect to their F0 characteristics, but also as to their much tenser articulation. A perception experiment performed with natural and resynthesized stimuli shows, inter alia, that tone 4 is most prone to confusion and that tone 6 obviously requires tense articulation as well as vocal fry to be identified reliably.","tags":null,"title":"Quantitative Analysis and Synthesis of Syllabic Tones in Vietnamese","type":"publication"}]
