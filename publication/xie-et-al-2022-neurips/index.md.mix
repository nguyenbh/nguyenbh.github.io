abstract = "We believe that every organization in the world should benefit from the power of these models, which is why Microsoftâ€™s AI at Scale initiative is making these large models â€“ and the systems and infrastructure to enable training and utilization â€“ available as a platform. Fueling this initiative is Microsoftâ€™s cutting-edge research on AI, guided by real-world applications and scenarios. Microsoft Research has been at the forefront of AI advancements with breakthroughs across natural-language processing, computer vision, speech recognition and more. We decided to develop platforms, tools and a supercomputing infrastructure that would allow any developer to build and scale their own AI innovation. At the Microsoft Build 2020 developer conference, we announced the Microsoft AI at Scale initiative, dedicated to giving all organizations access to these powerful AI models.Since then, continued progress in both fundamental and applied AI research has translated into ever-more transformative products, services and operations â€“ which Microsoft is committed to making accessible to all. This blog post explores the innovations behind the Microsoft AI at Scale initiative."
